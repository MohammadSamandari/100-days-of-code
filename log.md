# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
1. Android fundamentals 01.2 Part A: Your first interactive UI
2. Android fundamentals 01.2 Part B: The layout editor
3. Android fundamentals 01.3: Text and scrolling views

**Thoughts:** I begin my first day of coding with codelab project from Android tutorials. i think it is the best way of learning android development.

**The Noticable Thing I learned** 
1. we can create a different layout for landscape and portrait devices. To create a variant of the layout strictly for the horizontal orientation, leaving the vertical orientation layout alone: click the Orientation in Editor button and select Create Landscape Variation.
2. Use a ScrollView to scroll a single child View (such as a TextView). A ScrollView can hold only one child View or ViewGroup.
3. Use the android:autoLink="web" attribute to make web links in the text clickable.
