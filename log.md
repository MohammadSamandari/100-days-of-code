# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Android fundamentals 01.2 Part A: Your first interactive UI

**Thoughts:** I begin my first day of coding with codelab project from Android tutorials. i think it is the best way of learning android development. in this section i learned about
interactive ui and button and textviews but the best thing that i learned was screen variation.

**Creating layout variants for orientations and devices** we can create a different layout for landscape and portrait devices.
To create a variant of the layout strictly for the horizontal orientation, leaving the vertical orientation layout alone: click the Orientation in Editor button and select Create Landscape Variation.
